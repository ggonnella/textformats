count number of @SQ and total length
compute n_alignments vs that SQ
compute total length of alignment sequences
for each RG in header:
  print SM content and n alignments with that RG
for each tag found:
  print n alignments with that tag
for each CIGAR opcode:
  print total n operations and their total length in alignments
for each different FLAG:
  put n alignments with that FLAG
