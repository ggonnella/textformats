Test system:

- handling different order of the tags
  - what determines the order of the keys in a table?
    - similar problems in Python are solvable using a
      pre-defined hash seed
  - ordered table is not a good idea, because
    the tags are inherently not ordered, so equivalence
    should hold without regard to the order
  - define a canonical order? (e.g. lexicographic)
