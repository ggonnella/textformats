# This is a version of the GFA2 specification which
# does not use the exact specification of tags,
# but just a generic parsing of the name/type/value
# of the tags
#
# This file demonstrate how to redefine part of a
# specification
#
# Use gfa2.yaml for the specification including
# complete tags parsing

datatypes:
  # This is a re-definition of a previously defined datatype.
  #
  # Originally gfa::tags is defined in gfa.tags.yaml
  # and it consists of a "tagged_value" definition.
  #
  # Note that the definition uses a reference (to gfa::generic_tag).
  # References inside of re-definitions *must* use the same namespace
  # as the re-definition (thus the gfa::). This also if the
  # datatype to which it refers did not exist, as in this case.

  # Definition used by the reference of a re-definition.
  #
  # It is not a re-definition itself, since gfa::generic_tag did not exist yet.
  # Since it is used by a re-definition, however, it *must* use the same
  # namespace, hence the "gfa::". Note that it is not forbidden to add any
  # namespace to local definitions - as in this case.
