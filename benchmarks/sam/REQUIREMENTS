The htslib and libdeflate libraries must be installed.
The software was written using htslib 1.13 and libdeflate 1.7

The nimble file assumes that they are installed using conda,
but this is not a requirement.

To run the benchmark, install the libraries and input
the directory of conda or the directories of the packages
in the nimble file.
