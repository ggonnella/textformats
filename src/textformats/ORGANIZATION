support => generic modules (data structures, helper methods) independent from
           the rest of the library
types => datatypes specific for the library
*.nim => modules which define the main operations (decoding, encoding, etc)
dt_* => implementation of the operations for each of the datatype kinds
shared => code common to multiple datatypes (e.g. due to common options)
