Test system:

- handling different order of the tags
  - what determines the order of the keys in a table?
    - similar problems in Python are solvable using a
      pre-defined hash seed
  - ordered table is not a good idea, because
    the tags are inherently not ordered, so equivalence
    should hold without regard to the order
  - define a canonical order? (e.g. lexicographic)

Command line interface:

  If the YAML file is empty or contains only spaces,
  the NIM library outputs the following error:

  [NimYAML] Error in file stream.nim at line 176:
  assertion failed!
  [NimYAML] Stacktrace:
  No stack traceback available
  SIGSEGV: Illegal storage access. (Attempt to read from nil?)

  TODO:
  - check that the content of the file is not empty or consisting of only spaces
